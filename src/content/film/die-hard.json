      "analysis": "Die Hard is an iconic action film that set new standards for the genre with its high-octane sequences and charismatic lead. The film's success lies in its perfect blend of intense action, clever plot twists, and memorable one-liners. Bruce Willis' portrayal of John McClane, a wisecracking yet vulnerable hero, brought a new level of relatability to action protagonists. Alan Rickman's performance as the sophisticated villain Hans Gruber is equally compelling, creating a dynamic cat-and-mouse game that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. John McTiernan's direction ensures that the tension never lets up, making Die Hard a timeless classic that continues to influence action films today.",
