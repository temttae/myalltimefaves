Through the delicate interplay of present-day reflections and past experiences, the film beautifully captures the fleeting moments of joy and sorrow that define our relationships. The narrative structure, interwoven with miniDV footage, adds a layer of authenticity and nostalgia, emphasizing the subjective nature of memory. Charlotte Wells' direction, combined with Paul Mescal's and Frankie Corio's heartfelt performances, brings a raw and emotional depth to the story, making it a profound meditation on the bittersweet nature of growing up and letting go.",
